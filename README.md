# Inventory Creator

This is a simple piece of technology I wrote to quickly gather data about items for sale. It has minimal base functionality, but works well enough to quickly iterate and add more features. I likely won't iterate on this, it's done for what I need. Feel free to do what you want and use this how you'd see fit.
